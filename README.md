# BlackJacketJack
This game is a simple platformer. Jack keeps running until he dies and you must punch, jump and wall jump your way to victory. Made with libGDX for engine framework, box2D for physics and Tiled map editor for level editing.

Note: You may need to put the project in "C:\GameDev\Game" if you wish to mess around with it. Tiled is quite finnicky.
